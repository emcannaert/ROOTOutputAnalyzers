Hello Professor,

I am a PhD student working with John Conway in the UCD CMS group. My research with Professor Conway is focused on searches for ultra-heavy resonances decaying to pairs of heavy particles, and I am additionally involved with the Pixel Detector group on CMS. I am at the point where I am looking to complete my qualifying exam to advance to candidacy, and was hoping to be able to have you as a part of my committee. I was hoping to take my exam in the first two full weeks of December (Dec 6th to Dec 17th). Would you be willing to be on my committee for this?
