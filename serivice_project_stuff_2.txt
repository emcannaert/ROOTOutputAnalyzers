1. Chech the LV status of the modules in the detconfig
If module is not on:
Switch off the DCDC connected
Turn on the LV
For each DCDC:
Turn on + program the modules

To check LV status
a) Use `theLowVoltageMap_` to get module names and pw
b) Use one for loop to obtain DCDCs status per module ; then save in some datastructure A (tbc)
c) Use one loop to do the same but the power ; save datastructure B
d) merge A+B (probably need to find a fast way to do this)

Then once we have that we can start working on setting to the status we want; while updating the final datastructure of the changes.

Two connection structures would be needed:
module <-> PowerSupply
module <-> DCDC
and two status maps
LVStatus(PowerSupply)
DCDCStatus(DCDC)

Step1:
  As Previous comment says,  we need two structures:

    map/list<module,PowerSupply>
    map/list<module, DCDC>

Step2:
  For module to be ON, both LV and DCDC should be ON. So next:

    turn LV off per power supply in parallel (if not off already)
    turn off DCDCs per power supply in parallel (if enabled)
    Turn on LV per power supply in parallel
    DCDCs enabled per power supply in parallel; this should reduce (if not completely remove posibility of trips)

Step3: (...tbc...)
