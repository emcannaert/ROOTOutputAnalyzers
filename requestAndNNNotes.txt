thoughts about NN request
	- have the datacards to make gridpacks to submit
	- need to figure out how to do high HT QCD backgrund	
		-events simply don't exist far out enough for us to be able to train well here
			- would just be throwing out the signal events if we flatten in HT
	- 10m events for a request is really nothing


	- do we really need to do NN tagging for high Suu mass?
		- show plot comparing NN vs cut-based approaches
