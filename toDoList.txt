need to run algorithm on HT dataset

do event selection 

- HT > 1500 GeV
- DON'T do the strict AK8 jet mass -> maybe have require 2 high pT jets? or something to do with the dijet mass



- anti-tag first AK8 jet
- how often is second AK8 jet tagged? (per mass bin)


- counter -> array number for each mass bin -> 100 GeV per mass bin? -> total number of "mistagged" AK8 jet per mass bin
- counter -> array, number for each mass bin -> total number of events that are anti-tagged


- save this information in a text file somewhere 

--------------------------------------------------------------

-open data again
- tag first superjet
- apply mistagging efficieny to first superjet
	-Demand that it be tagged, then apply the mistagging efficiency from 1) above as a function of the near SJ momentum, p_SJ
-Calculate the disuperjet mass from assuming the far side four-momentum equals the near side four-momentum



-require near superjet be tagged, but far superjet be not tagged 
	- fake far superjet using mistagging rate and assume the 4 -momentum is opposite in direction

look at antitagged jets -> are there similar numbers of tagged / anti-tagged 


big to-do list

combine together all mass points of 

-------------NN stuff-----------------
statistcs for NN   - HT flattening
	- what to do about signal statistics ...
	- need to add together various SM + SUSY TTbar decays to get that to work
	- what do we do about QCD? 
		- what are options of SUSY -> QCD

	- between HT 1.5 TeV and 8 TeV ********
NN approach - test single NN trained with many different masses 
	- how well does this work
	- would make flattening easier because we could add together different mass points to flatten HT distribution	


Get NN to work in analyzer
	- how well does this pick out our signal MC?
	- should be similar performance to training/testing

-------------Background analysis--------------
Understand background estimation
	- compare MC and data yields
		-do I truly only get ~600 data events after pre-selection
	- what is correlation between superjets
	- is data-driven background estimate possible without unblinding
		- how do we deal with fact that we might have no statistics in high Suu/chi mass region
	- how can we drop various pre-selection cuts to improve efficiency
		- this might actually help us with the background estimate 
	-what does Res->TTbar->bbqqqq analysis do?
	- what does EXO paper do for their estimation?


--------------Misc-----------------------
Add in CA sorting method for splitting up event 
	- this doesn't seem to difficult



cSystemController.fFEDInterface    -> only pointer being referenced


-submited crab jobs for all different mass points -> will add these together and use these for training
- can you add together different types of QCD dataset to try and get enough statistics?
- TTtoHadronic, TTJets, Zprime -> TTbar, ...?
- train Wb, Ht, Zt for combined mass points
