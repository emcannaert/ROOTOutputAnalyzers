# ask MC contacts to accept in github branch
# do more with this control region - can I clean it up so there is less signal contamination
# look at muti's script and try to see what it's doing



# difference in b-tagging between control region and signal region?? 
	- more bjets causes higher SJ masses?
	- is this interfering with some specific process? 

# maybe raise pT requirement for b-tagged AK4 jets
	# 
# look at AK8 jets??

stuck in a situation because on in the (btag_loose < 2 and btag_med < 1) region do the SJ, diSJ, and SJ substructure plots match in QCD, but in signal this would give signficant signal contamination in control region 

cut out b-jets => gives many fewer events in high-mass disuperjet events, SJ masses, etc. ... 
	- increasing the pT requirement of bjets seems to only make it worse ...
